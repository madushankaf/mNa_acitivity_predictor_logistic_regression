# Adding a New Control Variable to the Logistic Regression Model

## Purpose
This guide outlines the steps to add a new control variable to the logistic regression model implemented in the R function `process_data_and_fit_logistic_regression_model`.

## Steps

1. **Identify the New Control Variable**
   - Determine the name and type of the new control variable you wish to add to the logistic regression model.

2. **Update the Data Reading and Transformation**
   - If necessary, ensure the new control variable is included in the dataset (`data_file`) provided to the function.
   - If any transformation is needed for the new variable, perform it accordingly.
     - **Examples of Transformations in R:**
       - Square root transformation: `sqrt(variable)`
       - Logarithmic transformation: `log(variable)`
       - Inverse transformation: `1/variable`

3. **Update the List of Independent Variables**
   - Add the name of the new control variable to the `independent_vars` vector defined in the function. 
   - Ensure the variable name matches exactly with how it appears in the dataset.

4. **Recalculate Correlation Matrix**
   - After adding the new control variable, recalculate the correlation matrix to assess its correlation with other independent variables.

5. **Update VIF Calculation**
   - Re-calculate the Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) to assess multicollinearity with the addition of the new control variable.

6. **Identify Highly Correlated Variables**
   - Check if the new control variable introduces high correlation with any existing independent variables. If so, handle multicollinearity appropriately.

7. **Update the Model Formula**
   - Update the formula used for model fitting to include the new control variable. Ensure the formula syntax is correct.

8. **Fit the Logistic Regression Model**
   - Fit the logistic regression model using the updated formula and include any necessary control parameters.

9. **Print Model Summary**
   - Print the summary of the logistic regression model to examine the coefficients, p-values, and goodness-of-fit statistics.

## Example Usage - adding control vars
```R
# Add a new control variable named 'New_Control_Var'
independent_vars <- c(
    'Policy_Uncertainty_Index',
    'Fed_Fund_Rate',
    'Log_News_Based_Policy_Uncert_Index',
    'New_Control_Var'
    # Add other variables as needed
)

# Recalculate correlation matrix, VIFs, and update the model formula and fitting
# ...
```
## Example Usage - running the model and predicting

# Call the function and store the logistic regression model
```R
model <- process_data_and_fit_logistic_regression_model("transformed_data.csv")

# Sample prediction using the model
sample_data <- data.frame(
  Policy_Uncertainty_Index = 0.5,
  Fed_Fund_Rate = 0.1,
  Log_News_Based_Policy_Uncert_Index = 1.2
  # Add other variables as needed
)

# Predict using the model
prediction <- predict(model, newdata = sample_data, type = "response")
print(prediction)
```
